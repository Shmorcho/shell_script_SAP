Task 1 and task 2 called SAP_task1.sh and SAP_task2.sh respectively should be run from console and they will used the resources in the folder. 
Task 3, 4 and 5 are in separate folders. They should be run from console with 2 parameters, representing file names - variabeles (variable list) and template. Because of the nature of the solution, task 4 and 5 have essentially the same code.
